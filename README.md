# Project-Warsztaty
It's my first ever project, that contain visualization about web-shop's main-pagge.
Goal of this project was to use HTML/CSS and just a little punch of jQuery code.
Then i just realized that we have something like Sass, flex boxes, vanila or library JS to use in for making it (let's say) better :). Training gives experience!.
